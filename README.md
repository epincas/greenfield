1. Create a "Counter" field on the Case standard Salesforce object that will count and display the number of children cases related to it. 
When a new children case is added to the a parent Case, the counter fields should be updated (same behaviour when a child Case is removed from that parent).

1. When the standad Status field on the Case is changed to 'Closed', then all children Cases should also be closed automatically.

Implement these 2 requirements without leveraging the standard functionalities Roll-Up Summary Field, Process Builder or Flows. Implement everything with apex.
