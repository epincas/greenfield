# Exercises to practice Apex

### Challenge # 1:
Create a counter field on the Case standard Sobject that will count and display its number of associated children cases. 
When a new child case is added to the a parent case, the counter field should automatically be updated (same behaviour when a child case is removed from that parent).

### Challenge # 2:
When the standad Status field on the parent Case is changed to 'Closed', then all its children Cases should also be automatically closed .

Implement the above mentioned 2 challenges with apex only (i.e. without leveraging any standard functionality of Salesforce such as Roll-Up Summary Field, Process Builder or Flows).
